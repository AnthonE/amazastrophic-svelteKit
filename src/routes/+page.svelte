			<h1 id="updated-risk-disclosure-">Risk Disclosure</h1>
			<p>Investing in a high-tech startup, such as Amazastrophic, the initial builders of Sage Towers, carries inherent risks. Potential investors need to be aware of these risks and make informed decisions. Below, we outline the potential risks associated with investing in Amazastrophic:</p>
			<h2 id="market-and-competition-">Market and Competition:</h2>
			<p>The gaming and metaverse industries are not just highly competitive but also rapidly evolving. With numerous established players and new startups entering the scene frequently, Amazastrophic faces the challenge of differentiating itself and securing a meaningful market share. While we strive for success, there is always a risk of not achieving our growth and market position targets due to market dynamics, competitive pressure, or changes in user preferences.</p>
			<h2 id="technological-complexity-">Technological Complexity:</h2>
			<p>Our work involves integrating cutting-edge technologies, like LLM (Large Learning Models) API&#39;s provided by companies such as OpenAI, which inherently carry the risk of developmental delays, increased costs, or unforeseen challenges. These could impact the timelines and success of our projects.</p>
			<h2 id="financial-risks-">Financial Risks:</h2>
			<p>Like any startup, there is a risk that we may not achieve profitability or generate sufficient revenue to sustain our operations. Additionally, initial valuations might not reflect the actual value of the company, especially in a volatile market. Investors must be prepared for the possibility that they may not recoup their initial investment or achieve their desired return.</p>
